                Before traveling to China, young adults and tourists should know where it’s located and more about
                its geography. Britcanna <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"> <a class= "suplink" href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a> </sup>
                states that China, located in Asia, stretches 3,250 miles from east to west
                and 3,400 miles from north to south. It’s bordered by Mongolia in the north; Russia and North Korea
                in the northeast; Vietnam, Laos, Burma, India, Bhutan, and Nepal to the west. South Korea and Japan
                are across the Yellow Sea which lies to the east of China. The Philippines lay beyond the South
                China Sea in the southeast. The temperatures in this area generally decrease south to north and
                around April, the mean temperature is above freezing for the whole place. Knowing where they are
                traveling should always be a priority of young adults, especially the adventurous ones.</div>

                What most grown-ups know is that China has been known to have a big population, but some don’t know

                were a total of around 13.7 million people inhabiting China. When sanitation and hygiene items
                became more widely produced, China had trouble keeping its population in check. Around 1962,
                contraceptives and late marriages were being promoted. By 1979, a law of having only one child was
                implemented and since then their population has dropped drastically. Reguardless of their measures
                to maintain a
                stable population, they still have a big population.

            <div class="bgg"> Throughout the years, young adults go through school continously learning that China has a
                huge
                market export. It's interesting to see and learn about as there may be stocks or factors in their
                market that young adults may take interest in. Since the 1990s, China has always had a good and
                balanced trade cycle. Prior to the
                war with
                communists
                countries, they maintained relatively good relations with them for trading, after the war, their
                relationship diminished. China instead built more relationships with noncommunist communities and as
                of
                today, Hong Kong is one of its most prominent partners in domestic trade. Most of the imports
                include
                things like chemicals, fuels, computer parts, chips, and machinery. To export their items out, they
                use the means of
                railways
                and waterways. Along the coastlines of China are ports or harbors which extend in two directions,
                north
                and south. Shanghai used to be the leading port in the 19th century until 1977 when Hong Kong took
                over.

                Most young adults travel for one reason: adventure. Though China may not look all that interesting,
                there are definitely monuments and cities worth seeing. The Translation Company <sup id="cite_ref-2"
                    class="reference"> <a class= "suplink" href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a> </sup>mentions that some
                major cities in China include Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong. Shanghai has the largest population
                in all of China and is a center for world technology, finance, fashion, and culture. Beijing
                contains a bunch of railways, roads, architecture, palaces, stone gates and temples. Hong Kong holds
                importance to the government as the special administrative regions (SAR) is located there and is run
                under different policies than mainland China. In these cities are also places people can visit to
                pass time and shop. Shanghai and Beijing, for example, have old ruins of palaces and temples while
                other regions have shopping centers. If tourists find themselves in any of China’s major cities,
                they should definitely visit Shanghai, Hong Kong, or Beijing. It’s a sight they wouldn’t want to
                miss.

                When going to a country, most young adults think of traveling for fun without prior research;
                however, they would not want to miss learning more about their culture before going to where
                everything started. According to Britcanna <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"> <a class= "suplink"
                        href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a> </sup>, in Chinese culture writing, dances, and music hold high
                importance to them. The bronze bells represent rewards while dances and rituals provide a structure
                for activities and festivals. Beijing is also known to be China’s cultural center as it holds the
                Chinese Academy of Sciences and several research institutes. Since the 1905s, new architectural
                discoveries from the past have been recovered and put into local museums. The most notable is the
                Shaanxi province which preserves the bodies of the terracotta warriors, horses, and chariots.
                Chinese cuisine can be organized in terms of Daoist principles; Hot is balanced by cold, spicy by
                mild, and fresh by cured. They tend to celebrate some of their own festivals and holidays like the
                Lantern festival, Spring festival, New Year’s day, and the Mid-Autumn Festival. After reading
                through, hopefully young adults wanting to explore China have enjoyed learning more about their
                culture, foods, and history.

                When teenagers and young adults think of China, some think only about their food and dances;
                however, there’s much more to China than just what’s on the surface. According to History <sup
                    id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"> <a class= "suplink" href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a> </sup>, China
                came to be during the 1600 B.C with the earliest dynasty being the Shang dynasty. Directly after the
                Shang dynasty came the Qin dynasty which was the first official empire. It was during the later
                dynasties like the Tang and the Han that paper, gunpowder, the printing press, and the Silk Road was
                used. The Ming dynasty marked when China started to expand overseas, but it was during the Qing when
                Britain attempted to take control using opium. After the opium wars, the Sino-Japanese war, and the
                Civil wars ended, the republic of China was formed. In 1996, the Cultural Revolution in which the
                Chinese reintroduced traditional Chinese back into their culture while erasing capitalists
                philosophies. As mentioned above, China has come a long way, a lot more than young adults and the
                newer generations see.
