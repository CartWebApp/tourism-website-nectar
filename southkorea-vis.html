            <p class="texty1">In South Korea, there are many places to stay while being here and getting a place to stay
                during the visit is crucial when young adults want to visit. There are many hotels travelers can stay at
                in South Korea. According to Smarter Travel<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a class="suplink"
                        href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>, hotels that have average rooms can be quite inexpensive
                outside of major tourist destinations and their prices can range on time of the year or local events.
                There are also luxury hotels equipped with a king-sized bed, swimming pools, and all the other modern
                features that allow travelers to have a nicer experience. South Korea has resorts that offer cruises to
                go around, deep-sea adventures, and other cruises for those who want to experience something unique.
                Another option for lodging is by staying in a South Korean guesthouse. South Koreans are known for being
                very hospitable towards others so staying at a family-run guest house allows visitors to experience what
                their everyday life is like. Smarter Travel<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a class="suplink"
                        href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> says that staying at a temple is one of the most unique
                experiences ever since there are monks who walk around in the perfectly manicured garden and can join
                them in prayer, enjoy simple meals, and meditate whenever. One of the most traditional ways to lodge is
                by staying at Hanok. According to Smarter Travel<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a class="suplink"
                        href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>, it is described to have clay-tiled roofs, massive
                wooden support beams, overhanging eaves, peaceful, and quiet. It is a place to help disconnect from
                everything that can be distracting like wifi and TV. South Korea Yeogwans another type of lodging that
                allows the travelers to stay in a room with the mattress on the floor since Koreans believed that when
                they travel in groups, removing the bed would allow more people to be in the room. It is a cheap
                alternative compared to other places and allows guests to share restrooms and dining facilities. South
                Korea also offers a cheaper substitute for hotels which are Minbaks which are a much cheaper option but
                unlike the other lodges their rooms don’t have beds sometimes. In addition, restrooms and kitchens are
                provided but are shared with others. Lastly, hostels have tidy dorm rooms, shared kitchen facilities,
                clean bathrooms, and community living spaces just like any other hostel in the world. There are many
                options to stay at and choose from when visiting South Korea. So depending on the young adult’s budget,
                it can determine which place they can stay at and which places they want to save up for.

        <p class="tej">There are multiple ways for young adults nowadays to travel to South Korea since there is so much
            technological advance that allows young people to easily find ways to get to South Korea. One of the best
            ways to get to South Korea is going on an airplane. There are multiple different flights that are available
            for those who want to fly to South Korea. According to Rough Guides<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a class="flio"
                    href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>, there are flights from the UK and
            Ireland, flights from the US and Canada, flights from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and flights
            from Japan and China. There are also ferries travelers can take since there are several ferry routes from
            China’s eastern coast. There are services from Japan departing from Fukuoka and Shimonoseki to Busan which
            arrive reasonably close to Busan train station making it very convenient to get anywhere in South Korea.
            Those are the best and most convenient ways for young adults between the ages of 18 to 29 to travel to South
            Korea.</p>

            <p class="texty1">There are many different ways to travel around South Korea for young adults nowadays. One
                way
                is by flying around Incheon Airport. According to Adventure Teaching<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a
                        class="suplink" href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>, the Incheon Airport is the busiest and
                largest airport in the world. They are the most widely used international airport in Korea. There are
                also
                numerous intra-city and inter-city buses with color-coded systems to help commuters make their way more
                efficiently. For intra-city buses, the price will be around 500won (which is less than 50 cents) and
                when
                using intercity buses it would cost around 1800won or more depending on the desired destination. Another
                public transportation tourists can use is by using subways since they are known for having the most
                extensive subways systems in the world. They connect to the Greater Seoul Area and extend to most of the
                city’s biggest suburbs. There are also trains in South Korea which allow tourists to travel longer
                distances
                comfortably and cheaply. Adventure Teaching<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a class="suplink"
                        href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> says there are also bicycles, scooters, and cars to use to
                beat
                traffic, see the city, visit friends and get some exercise which are great alternatives to using public
                transportation. According to Smarter Travel<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a class="suplink"
                        href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>, there are also ferries in South Korea that allow travelers to
                go to major destinations like Busan, Incheon, Jeju, Mokp, and Ulleungdo. Adults between the ages of 18
                to 29
                need to know how to travel within South Korea so they have an easier time getting around.
