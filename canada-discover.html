        <div class="p2">Thanksgiving is one of the smaller holidays that is still commonly celebrated in both the United
            States and Canada. Even with all their similarities, both countries have notable differences in celebrating
            the holiday and the origins in which it came about. For starters, according to Alison Nagy’s “The History of
            Thanksgiving in Canada,”<sub id="cite_ref-1"><a class="superlink" href="cite_note-1">[1]</a></sub> the first
            American Thanksgiving took place 43 years after Canada’s in 1578. After 1606, Thanksgivings were held
            sporadically up until it was set to be held on November 6th in 1879. In modern day, Canada’s Thanksgiving
            finds itself having been on the second Monday of October since 1957 due to November 11th’s Remembrance Day.
            <br><br>
            As it is now, America and Canada have incredibly similar celebrations. However, Canada’s celebration of
            Thanksgiving seems to be a lot calmer and casual. In Ellen Gray’s “A Brief History of Canadian
            Thanksgiving,”<sub id="cite_ref-2"><a class="superlink" href="cite_note-2">[2]</a></sub> she says “the most
            fascinating aspect of Canadian Thanksgiving is the casualness of it all.”
            Canada does still have football Sunday within the same week; it often looks like families watching the
            Thanksgiving Day Classic hosted by the Canadian Football League. Black Friday, however, is not something
            that Canadians have (a possible result of having Thanksgiving on a Monday). Their equivalent is called
            Boxing Day and is celebrated on the day after Christmas. Even though there are differences between the two,
            American and Canadian celebrations of Thanksgiving aren’t that different.

        <div class="p2">On the border between Ontario and New York sits Niagara Falls, a 176 feet tall, 1060 foot long
            waterfall. Different areas of it have different names based on where they’re located, like the Horseshoe
            Falls (Canadian Falls) in Ontario, Canada. As magnificent as it seems, the Falls are relatively young
            compared to the rest of the world. Aging around 12,000 years, the Falls are a remnant of the last Ice Age in
            the Niagara Peninsula according to Niagara Falls Live. The water flow still goes mostly uncontrolled in
            modern day with over 12 million people visiting the falls annually.</div>
